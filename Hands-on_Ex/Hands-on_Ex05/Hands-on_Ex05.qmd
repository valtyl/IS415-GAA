# 5.1 Overview

Spatial Point Pattern Analysis is the evaluation of the pattern or distribution, of a set of points on a surface. The point can be location of:

-   events such as crime, traffic accident and disease onset, or
-   business services (coffee and fastfood outlets) or facilities such as childcare and eldercare.

Using appropriate functions of [spatstat](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spatstat/), this hands-on exercise aims to discover the spatial point processes of childecare centres in Singapore.

The specific questions we would like to answer are as follows:

-   are the childcare centres in Singapore randomly distributed throughout the country?
-   if the answer is not, then the next logical question is where are the locations with higher concentration of childcare centres?

# 5.2 The data

To provide answers to the questions above, three data sets will be used. They are:

-   `CHILDCARE`, a point feature data providing both location and attribute information of childcare centres. It was downloaded from Data.gov.sg and is in geojson format.
-   `MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL`, a polygon feature data providing information of URA 2014 Master Plan Planning Subzone boundary data. It is in ESRI shapefile format. This data set was also downloaded from Data.gov.sg.
-   `CostalOutline`, a polygon feature data showing the national boundary of Singapore. It is provided by SLA and is in ESRI shapefile format.

# 5.3 Installing and Loading the R packages

In this hands-on exercise, five R packages will be used, they are:

-   [**sf**](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/), a relatively new R package specially designed to import, manage and process vector-based geospatial data in R.
-   [**spatstat**](https://spatstat.org/), which has a wide range of useful functions for point pattern analysis. In this hands-on exercise, it will be used to perform 1st- and 2nd-order spatial point patterns analysis and derive kernel density estimation (KDE) layer.
-   [**raster**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/) which reads, writes, manipulates, analyses and model of gridded spatial data (i.e. raster). In this hands-on exercise, it will be used to convert image output generate by spatstat into raster format.
-   [**maptools**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maptools/) which provides a set of tools for manipulating geographic data. In this hands-on exercise, we mainly use it to convert *Spatial* objects into *ppp* format of **spatstat**.
-   [**tmap**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/) which provides functions for plotting cartographic quality static point patterns maps or interactive maps by using [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) API.

Use the code chunk below to install and launch the five R packages.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(maptools, sf, raster, spatstat, tmap)
```

# 5.4 Spatial Data Wrangling

## 5.4.1 Importing the spatial data

```{r}
childcare_sf <- st_read("data/child-care-services-geojson.geojson") %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3414)
```

```{r}
sg_sf <- st_read(dsn = "data", layer="CostalOutline")
```

```{r}
mpsz_sf <- st_read(dsn = "data", 
                layer = "MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL")
```

### \[DIY\] Retrieve the referencing system information of these geospatial data

```{r}
st_crs(childcare_sf)
```

```{r}
st_crs(sg_sf)
```

```{r}
st_crs(mpsz_sf)
```

### \[DIY\] Assign the correct CRS to mpsz_sf and sg_sf simple feature data frames

```{r}
sg_sf_3414 <- st_transform(sg_sf, crs=3414)
st_crs(sg_sf_3414)
```

```{r}
mpsz_sf_3414 <- st_transform(mpsz_sf, crs=3414)
st_crs(mpsz_sf_3414)
```

### \[DIY\] If necessary, change the referencing system to Singapore national projected coordinate system

## 5.4.2 Mapping the geospatial data sets

After checking the referencing system of each geospatial data data frame, it is also useful for us to plot a map to show their spatial patterns.

```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")
qtm(childcare_sf)
```

Notice that all the geospatial layers are within the same map extend. This shows that their referencing system and coordinate values are referred to similar spatial context. This is very important in any geospatial analysis.

Alternatively, we can also prepare a pin map by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
sf_use_s2(FALSE)
tmap_mode('view')
tm_shape(childcare_sf)+
  tm_dots()
```

```{r}
tmap_mode('plot')
```

Notice that at the interactive mode, **tmap** is using [**leaflet for R**](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) API. The advantage of this interactive pin map is it allows us to navigate and zoom around the map freely. We can also query the information of each simple feature (i.e. the point) by clicking of them. Last but not least, you can also change the background of the internet map layer. Currently, three internet map layers are provided. They are: ESRI.WorldGrayCanvas, OpenStreetMap, and ESRI.WorldTopoMap. The default is ESRI.WorldGrayCanvas.

> Reminder: Always remember to switch back to plot mode after the interactive map. This is because, each interactive mode will consume a connection. You should also avoid displaying ecessive numbers of interactive maps (i.e. not more than 10) in one RMarkdown document when publish on Netlify.

# 5.5 Geospatial Data Wrangling

Although simple feature data frame is gaining popularity again sp's Spatial\* classes, there are, however, many geospatial analysis packages require the input geospatial data in sp's Spatial\* classes. In this section, you will learn how to convert simple feature data frame to sp's Spatial\* class.

## 5.5.1 Converting sf data frames to sp's Spatial\* class

The code chunk below uses [*as_Spatial()*](https://r4gdsa.netlify.app/chap04.html) of **sf** package to convert the three geospatial data from simple feature data frame to sp's Spatial\* class.

```{r}
childcare <- as_Spatial(childcare_sf)
mpsz <- as_Spatial(mpsz_sf)
sg <- as_Spatial(sg_sf)
```

```{r}
childcare
```

```{r}
mpsz
```

```{r}
sg
```

## 5.5.2 Converting the Spatial\* class into generic sp format

**spatstat** requires the analytical data in ***ppp*** object form. There is no direct way to convert a Spatial\* classes into ***ppp*** object. We need to convert the ***Spatial*** **classes**\* into ***Spatial*** object first.

The codes chunk below converts the Spatial\* classes into generic sp objects.

```{r}
childcare_sp <- as(childcare, "SpatialPoints")
sg_sp <- as(sg, "SpatialPolygons")
```

Next, you should display the sp objects properties as shown below.

```{r}
childcare_sp
```

```{r}
sg_sp
```

## 5.5.3 Converting the generic sp format into spatstat's ppp format

Now, we will use *as.ppp()* function of **spatstat** to convert the spatial data into **spatstat**'s **ppp** object format.

```{r}
childcare_ppp <- as(childcare_sp, "ppp")
childcare_ppp
```

Now, let us plot **childcare_ppp** and examine the different.

```{r}
plot(childcare_ppp)
```

You can take a quick look at the summary statistics of the newly created ppp object by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
summary(childcare_ppp)
```

Notice the warning message about duplicates. In spatial point patterns analysis an issue of significant is the presence of duplicates. The statistical methodology used for spatial point patterns processes is based largely on the assumption that process are simple, that is, that the points cannot be coincident.

## 5.5.4 Handling duplicated points

We can check the duplication in a **ppp** object by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
any(duplicated(childcare_ppp))
```

To count the number of co-indicence point, we will use the multiplicity() function as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r}
multiplicity(childcare_ppp)
```

If we want to know how many locations have more than one point event, we can use the code chunk below.

```{r}
sum(multiplicity(childcare_ppp) > 1)
```

The output shows that there are 128 duplicated point events.

To view the locations of these duplicate point events, we will plot `childcare` data by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
tmap_mode('view')
tm_shape(childcare) +
  tm_dots(alpha=0.4,
          size=0.05)
```

```{r}
tmap_mode('plot')
```

There are three ways to overcome this problem. The easiest way is to delete the duplicates. But, that will also mean that some useful point events will be lost.

The second solution is use *jittering*, which will add a small perturbation to the duplicate points so that they do not occupy the exact same space.

The third solution is to make each point "unique" and then attach the duplicates of the points to the patterns as **marks**, as attributes of the points. Then you would need analytical techniques that take into account these marks.

The code chunk below implements the jittering approach.

```{r}
childcare_ppp_jit <- rjitter(childcare_ppp,
                             retry=TRUE,
                             nsim=1,
                             drop=TRUE)
```

Check if any duplicated point is in this geospatial data

```{r}
any(duplicated(childcare_ppp_jit))
```

## 5.5.5 Creating *owin* object

When analysing spatial point patterns, it is a good practice to confine the analysis with a geographical area like Singapore boundary. In **spatstat**, an object called ***owin*** is specially designed to represent this polygonal region.

The code chunk below is used to covert *sg* SpatialPolygon object into owin object of **spatstat**.

```{r}
sg_owin <- as(sg_sp, "owin")
```

The ouput object can be displayed by using *plot()* function

```{r}
plot(sg_owin)
```

and *summary()* function of Base R

```{r}
summary(sg_owin)
```

## 5.5.6 Combining point events object and owin object

In this last step of geospatial data wrangling, we will extract childcare events that are located within Singapore by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
childcareSG_ppp = childcare_ppp[sg_owin]
```

The output object combined both the point and polygon feature in one ppp object class as shown below.

```{r}
summary(childcareSG_ppp)
```

### \[DIY\] Plot the newly derived childcareSG_ppp

### 5.5.6.1 Extracting study area

The code chunk below will be used to extract the target planning areas.

```{r}
pg = mpsz[mpsz@data$PLN_AREA_N == "PUNGGOL",]
tm = mpsz[mpsz@data$PLN_AREA_N == "TAMPINES",]
ck = mpsz[mpsz@data$PLN_AREA_N == "CHOA CHU KANG",]
jw = mpsz[mpsz@data$PLN_AREA_N == "JURONG WEST",]
```

Plotting target planning areas

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(pg, main = "Ponggol")
plot(tm, main = "Tampines")
plot(ck, main = "Choa Chu Kang")
plot(jw, main = "Jurong West")
```

### 5.5.6.2 Converting the spatial point data frame into generic sp format

Next, we will convert these SpatialPolygonsDataFrame layers into generic spatialpolygons layers.

```{r}
pg_sp = as(pg, "SpatialPolygons")
tm_sp = as(tm, "SpatialPolygons")
ck_sp = as(ck, "SpatialPolygons")
jw_sp = as(jw, "SpatialPolygons")
```

### 5.5.6.3 Creating owin object

Now, we will convert these SpatialPolygons objects into owin objects that is required by spatstat.

```{r}
pg_owin = as(pg_sp, "owin")
tm_owin = as(tm_sp, "owin")
ck_owin = as(ck_sp, "owin")
jw_owin = as(jw_sp, "owin")
```

### 5.5.6.4 Combining childcare points and the study area

By using the code chunk below, we are able to extract childcare that is within the specific region to do our analysis later on.

```{r}
childcare_pg_ppp = childcare_ppp_jit[pg_owin]
childcare_tm_ppp = childcare_ppp_jit[tm_owin]
childcare_ck_ppp = childcare_ppp_jit[ck_owin]
childcare_jw_ppp = childcare_ppp_jit[jw_owin]
```

Next, rescale() function is used to trasnform the unit of measurement from metre to kilometre.

```{r}
childcare_pg_ppp.km = rescale(childcare_pg_ppp, 1000, "km")
childcare_tm_ppp.km = rescale(childcare_tm_ppp, 1000, "km")
childcare_ck_ppp.km = rescale(childcare_ck_ppp, 1000, "km")
childcare_jw_ppp.km = rescale(childcare_jw_ppp, 1000, "km")
```

The code chunk below is used to plot these four study areas and the locations of the childcare centres.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(childcare_pg_ppp.km, main="Punggol")
plot(childcare_tm_ppp.km, main="Tampines")
plot(childcare_ck_ppp.km, main="Choa Chu Kang")
plot(childcare_jw_ppp.km, main="Jurong West")
```

L_ck = Lest(childcare_ck_ppp, correction = "Ripley")
plot(L_ck, . -r ~ r, 
     ylab= "L(d)-r", xlab = "d(m)")
```

-   edge correction via the correction attribute is Lest() is to take care of the modified edge defect
-   in the algorithm, the boundary is extended slightly, so that we can include the points at the edge
-   anything above red line is clustering
-   anything below red line is regular pattern
-   but we don't know if the clustering or regular pattern is statistically confident
-   to draw the conclusion, we need the envelope to run simulations

### 5.10.1.2 Performing Complete Spatial Randomness Test

To confirm the observed spatial patterns above, a hypothesis test will be conducted. The hypothesis and test are as follows:

Ho = The distribution of childcare services at Choa Chu Kang are randomly distributed.

H1= The distribution of childcare services at Choa Chu Kang are not randomly distributed.

The null hypothesis will be rejected if p-value if smaller than alpha value of 0.001.

The code chunk below is used to perform the hypothesis testing.

```{r}
L_ck.csr <- envelope(childcare_ck_ppp, Lest, nsim = 99, rank = 1, glocal=TRUE)
```

```{r}
plot(L_ck.csr, . - r ~ r, xlab="d", ylab="L(d)-r")
```

-   altho the envelope looks like a grey area, it is actualy made up of lines

-   the envelope is made up of 100 grey lines since 99 simulations are run

-   to use 95% confidence interval, need to run 49 simulations

-   for 99% confidence interval, run 99 simulations

-   for 99.9% confidence interval, run 999 simulations

-   conclusion: don't have enough statistical evidence to reject null, fail to reject the null hypothesis at 99% confidence interval bc they are not all outside the envelope

-   anything that fall inside envelope, cannot reject null, outside then have enough stats evidence to reject the null

-   Conclusion: null hypothesis says that the childcare centres are randomly distributed \> but from the graph, there is a portion where the black line is in the white area \> this means that at a certain distance, the childcare centres are clustered \> if the whole black line is OUTSIDE the envelope, it will mean that the childcare centres are clustered. if the whole black lines is INSIDE the envelope, it will mean that the childcare centres are randomly distributed. \> unless the whole black line is outside, we cannot reject the null hypothesis (cannot say that it is not randomly distributed). only if the whole black line is outside, we can say it is clustered and we can accept H1 that it is not random, then reject H0

-   at about 480km between childcare centres, the childcare centres show since of clustering (white area)

-   black line is alpha value, black lines protrude means p-value is smaller than alpha value

## 5.10.2 Tampines planning area

### 5.10.2.1 Computing L-function estimate

```{r}
L_tm = Lest(childcare_tm_ppp, correction = "Ripley")
plot(L_tm, . -r ~ r, 
     ylab= "L(d)-r", xlab = "d(m)", 
     xlim=c(0,1000))
```

### 5.10.2.2 Performing Complete Spatial Randomness Test

Ho = The distribution of childcare services at Tampines are randomly distributed.

H1= The distribution of childcare services at Tampines are not randomly distributed.

The null hypothesis will be rejected if p-value is smaller than alpha value of 0.001.

The code chunk below will be used to perform the hypothesis testing.

```{r}
L_tm.csr <- envelope(childcare_tm_ppp, Lest, nsim = 99, rank = 1, glocal=TRUE)
```

     xlab="d", ylab="L(d)-r", xlim=c(0,500))
```
